## 41 General-purpose timers (TIM15/TIM16/TIM17)

### 41.1 TIM15/TIM16/TIM17 introduction

```
The TIM15/TIM16/TIM17 timers consist of a 16-bit auto-reload counter driven by a
programmable prescaler.
```
```
They may be used for a variety of purposes, including measuring the pulse lengths of input
signals (input capture) or generating output waveforms (output compare, PWM,
complementary PWM with dead-time insertion).
```
```
Pulse lengths and waveform periods can be modulated from a few microseconds to several
milliseconds using the timer prescaler and the RCC clock controller prescalers.
```
```
The TIM15/TIM16/TIM17 timers are completely independent, and do not share any
resources. TIM15 can be synchronized as described in Section 41.4.22: Timer
synchronization (TIM15).
```
### 41.2 TIM15 main features

TIM15 includes the following features:

- 16-bit auto-reload upcounter
- 16-bit programmable prescaler used to divide (also “on the fly”) the counter clock
    frequency by any factor between 1 and 65535
- Up to 2 independent channels for:
    - Input capture
    - Output compare
    - PWM generation (edge mode)
    - One-pulse mode output
- Complementary outputs with programmable dead-time (for channel 1 only)
- Synchronization circuit to control the timer with external signals and to interconnect
    several timers together
- Repetition counter to update the timer registers only after a given number of cycles of
    the counter
- Break input to put the timer’s output signals in the reset state or a known state
- Interrupt/DMA generation on the following events:
    - Update: counter overflow, counter initialization (by software or internal/external
       trigger)
    - Trigger event (counter start, stop, initialization or count by internal/external trigger)
    - Input capture
    - Output compare
    - Break input (interrupt request)

### 41.4 TIM15/TIM16/TIM17 functional description

##### 41.4.1 Time-base unit

```
The main block of the programmable advanced-control timer is a 16-bit upcounter with its
related auto-reload register. The counter clock can be divided by a prescaler.
```
```
The counter, the auto-reload register and the prescaler register can be written or read by
software. This is true even when the counter is running.
```
The time-base unit includes:

- Counter register (TIMx_CNT)
- Prescaler register (TIMx_PSC)
- Auto-reload register (TIMx_ARR)
- Repetition counter register (TIMx_RCR)

```
The auto-reload register is preloaded. Writing to or reading from the auto-reload register
accesses the preload register. The content of the preload register are transferred into the
shadow register permanently or at each update event (UEV), depending on the auto-reload
preload enable bit (ARPE) in TIMx_CR1 register. The update event is sent when the counter
reaches the overflow and if the UDIS bit equals 0 in the TIMx_CR1 register. It can also be
generated by software. The generation of the update event is described in detailed for each
configuration.
```
```
The counter is clocked by the prescaler output CK_CNT, which is enabled only when the
counter enable bit (CEN) in TIMx_CR1 register is set (refer also to the slave mode controller
description to get more details on counter enabling).
```
```
Note that the counter starts counting 1 clock cycle after setting the CEN bit in the TIMx_CR1
register.
```
**Prescaler description**

```
The prescaler can divide the counter clock frequency by any factor between 1 and 65536. It
is based on a 16-bit counter controlled through a 16-bit register (in the TIMx_PSC register).
It can be changed on the fly as this control register is buffered. The new prescaler ratio is
taken into account at the next update event.
```
```
Figure 482 and Figure 483 give some examples of the counter behavior when the prescaler
ratio is changed on the fly:

##### 41.4.2 Counter modes

**Upcounting mode**

```
In upcounting mode, the counter counts from 0 to the auto-reload value (content of the
TIMx_ARR register), then restarts from 0 and generates a counter overflow event.
```
```
If the repetition counter is used, the update event (UEV) is generated after upcounting is
repeated for the number of times programmed in the repetition counter register
(TIMx_RCR). Else the update event is generated at each counter overflow.
```
```
Setting the UG bit in the TIMx_EGR register (by software or by using the slave mode
controller) also generates an update event.
```
```
The UEV event can be disabled by software by setting the UDIS bit in the TIMx_CR1
register. This is to avoid updating the shadow registers while writing new values in the
preload registers. Then no update event occurs until the UDIS bit has been written to 0.
However, the counter restarts from 0, as well as the counter of the prescaler (but the
prescale rate does not change). In addition, if the URS bit (update request selection) in
TIMx_CR1 register is set, setting the UG bit generates an update event UEV but without
setting the UIF flag (thus no interrupt or DMA request is sent). This is to avoid generating
both update and capture interrupts when clearing the counter on the capture event.
```
```
When an update event occurs, all the registers are updated and the update flag (UIF bit in
TIMx_SR register) is set (depending on the URS bit):
```
- The repetition counter is reloaded with the content of TIMx_RCR register,
- The auto-reload shadow register is updated with the preload value (TIMx_ARR),
- The buffer of the prescaler is reloaded with the preload value (content of the TIMx_PSC
    register).

```
The following figures show some examples of the counter behavior for different clock
frequencies when TIMx_ARR=0x36.
```

##### 41.4.3 Repetition counter

```
Section 41.4.1: Time-base unit describes how the update event (UEV) is generated with
respect to the counter overflows. It is actually generated only when the repetition counter
has reached zero. This can be useful when generating PWM signals.
```
```
This means that data are transferred from the preload registers to the shadow registers
(TIMx_ARR auto-reload register, TIMx_PSC prescaler register, but also TIMx_CCRx
capture/compare registers in compare mode) every N counter overflows, where N is the
value in the TIMx_RCR repetition counter register.
```
The repetition counter is decremented at each counter overflow.

```
The repetition counter is an auto-reload type; the repetition rate is maintained as defined by
the TIMx_RCR register value (refer to Figure 490 ). When the update event is generated by
software (by setting the UG bit in TIMx_EGR register) or by hardware through the slave
mode controller, it occurs immediately whatever the value of the repetition counter is and the
repetition counter is reloaded with the content of the TIMx_RCR register.
```

1772/3353 RM0433 Rev 8

```
Figure 490. Update rate examples depending on mode and TIMx_RCR register
settings
```
##### 41.4.4 Clock selection

The counter clock can be provided by the following clock sources:

- Internal clock (CK_INT)
- External clock mode1: external input pin
- Internal trigger inputs (ITRx) (only for TIM15): using one timer as the prescaler for
    another timer, for example, TIM1 can be configured to act as a prescaler for TIM15.
    Refer to _Using one timer as prescaler for another timer on page 1670_ for more details.

**Internal clock source (CK_INT)**

```
If the slave mode controller is disabled (SMS=000), then the CEN (in the TIMx_CR1
register) and UG bits (in the TIMx_EGR register) are actual control bits and can be changed

```
only by software (except UG which remains cleared automatically). As soon as the CEN bit
is written to 1, the prescaler is clocked by the internal clock CK_INT.
```
```
Figure 491 shows the behavior of the control circuit and the upcounter in normal mode,
without prescaler.
```

**External clock source mode 1**

```
This mode is selected when SMS=111 in the TIMx_SMCR register. The counter can count at
each rising or falling edge on a selected input.
```

1. Select the proper TI2[x] source (internal or external) with the TI2SEL[3:0] bits in the
    TIMx_TISEL register.
2. Configure channel 2 to detect rising edges on the TI2 input by writing CC2S = ‘01’ in
    the TIMx_CCMR1 register.
3. Configure the input filter duration by writing the IC2F[3:0] bits in the TIMx_CCMR1
    register (if no filter is needed, keep IC2F=0000).
4. Select rising edge polarity by writing CC2P=0 in the TIMx_CCER register.
5. Configure the timer in external clock mode 1 by writing SMS=111 in the TIMx_SMCR
    register.
6. Select TI2 as the trigger input source by writing TS=00110 in the TIMx_SMCR register.
7. Enable the counter by writing CEN=1 in the TIMx_CR1 register.

_Note: The capture prescaler is not used for triggering, so it does not need to be configured._

When a rising edge occurs on TI2, the counter counts once and the TIF flag is set.

```
The delay between the rising edge on TI2 and the actual clock of the counter is due to the
resynchronization circuit on TI2 input.
```
**Figure 493. Control circuit in external clock mode 1**

##### 41.4.5 Capture/compare channels

```
Each Capture/Compare channel is built around a capture/compare register (including a
shadow register), a input stage for capture (with digital filter, multiplexing and prescaler) and
an output stage (with comparator and output control).
```
_Figure 494_ to _Figure 497_ give an overview of one Capture/Compare channel.

```
The input stage samples the corresponding TIx input to generate a filtered signal TIxF.
Then, an edge detector with polarity selection generates a signal (TIxFPx) which can be
used as trigger input by the slave mode controller or as the capture command. It is
prescaled before the capture register (ICxPS).

The capture/compare block is made of one preload register and one shadow register. Write

In capture mode, captures are actually done in the shadow register, which is copied into the
preload register.

```
In compare mode, the content of the preload register is copied into the shadow register
which is compared to the counter.

##### 41.4.6 Input capture mode

```
In Input capture mode, the Capture/Compare registers (TIMx_CCRx) are used to latch the
value of the counter after a transition detected by the corresponding ICx signal. When a
capture occurs, the corresponding CCXIF flag (TIMx_SR register) is set and an interrupt or
a DMA request can be sent if they are enabled. If a capture occurs while the CCxIF flag was

```
already high, then the over-capture flag CCxOF (TIMx_SR register) is set. CCxIF can be
cleared by software by writing it to ‘0’ or by reading the captured data stored in the
TIMx_CCRx register. CCxOF is cleared when it is written with 0.
```
```
The following example shows how to capture the counter value in TIMx_CCR1 when TI1
input rises. To do this, use the following procedure:
```
1. Select the proper TI1x source (internal or external) with the TI1SEL[3:0] bits in the
    TIMx_TISEL register.
2. Select the active input: TIMx_CCR1 must be linked to the TI1 input, so write the CC1S
    bits to 01 in the TIMx_CCMR1 register. As soon as CC1S becomes different from 00,
    the channel is configured in input and the TIMx_CCR1 register becomes read-only.
3. Program the appropriate input filter duration in relation with the signal connected to the
    timer (when the input is one of the TIx (ICxF bits in the TIMx_CCMRx register). Let’s
    imagine that, when toggling, the input signal is not stable during at least 5 internal clock
    cycles. We must program a filter duration longer than these 5 clock cycles. We can
    validate a transition on TI1 when 8 consecutive samples with the new level have been
    detected (sampled at fDTS frequency). Then write IC1F bits to 0011 in the
    TIMx_CCMR1 register.
4. Select the edge of the active transition on the TI1 channel by writing CC1P bit to 0 in
    the TIMx_CCER register (rising edge in this case).
5. Program the input prescaler. In our example, we wish the capture to be performed at
    each valid transition, so the prescaler is disabled (write IC1PS bits to ‘00’ in the
    TIMx_CCMR1 register).
6. Enable capture from the counter into the capture register by setting the CC1E bit in the
    TIMx_CCER register.
7. If needed, enable the related interrupt request by setting the CC1IE bit in the
    TIMx_DIER register, and/or the DMA request by setting the CC1DE bit in the
    TIMx_DIER register.

When an input capture occurs:

- The TIMx_CCR1 register gets the value of the counter on the active transition.
- CC1IF flag is set (interrupt flag). CC1OF is also set if at least two consecutive captures
    occurred whereas the flag was not cleared.
- An interrupt is generated depending on the CC1IE bit.
- A DMA request is generated depending on the CC1DE bit.

```
In order to handle the overcapture, it is recommended to read the data before the
overcapture flag. This is to avoid missing an overcapture which could happen after reading
the flag and before reading the data.
```
_Note: IC interrupt and/or DMA requests can be generated by software by setting the_

_corresponding CCxG bit in the TIMx_EGR register._

##### 41.4.7 PWM input mode (only for TIM15)

This mode is a particular case of input capture mode. The procedure is the same except:

- Two ICx signals are mapped on the same TIx input.
- These 2 ICx signals are active on edges with opposite polarity.
- One of the two TIxFP signals is selected as trigger input and the slave mode controller
    is configured in reset mode.


**General-purpose timers (TIM15/TIM16/TIM17) RM0433**

1778/3353 RM0433 Rev 8

```
For example, one can measure the period (in TIMx_CCR1 register) and the duty cycle (in
TIMx_CCR2 register) of the PWM applied on TI1 using the following procedure (depending
on CK_INT frequency and prescaler value):
```
1. Select the proper TI1[x] source (internal or external) with the TI1SEL[3:0] bits in the
    TIMx_TISEL register.
2. Select the active input for TIMx_CCR1: write the CC1S bits to 01 in the TIMx_CCMR1
    register (TI1 selected).
3. Select the active polarity for TI1FP1 (used both for capture in TIMx_CCR1 and counter
    clear): write the CC1P and CC1NP bits to ‘0’ (active on rising edge).
4. Select the active input for TIMx_CCR2: write the CC2S bits to 10 in the TIMx_CCMR1
    register (TI1 selected).
5. Select the active polarity for TI1FP2 (used for capture in TIMx_CCR2): write the CC2P
    and CC2NP bits to ‘10’ (active on falling edge).
6. Select the valid trigger input: write the TS bits to 00101 in the TIMx_SMCR register
    (TI1FP1 selected).
7. Configure the slave mode controller in reset mode: write the SMS bits to 100 in the
    TIMx_SMCR register.
8. Enable the captures: write the CC1E and CC2E bits to ‘1’ in the TIMx_CCER register.

**Figure 498. PWM input mode timing**

1. The PWM input mode can be used only with the TIMx_CH1/TIMx_CH2 signals due to the fact that only
    TI1FP1 and TI2FP2 are connected to the slave mode controller.

##### 41.4.8 Forced output mode

```
In output mode (CCxS bits = 00 in the TIMx_CCMRx register), each output compare signal
(OCxREF and then OCx/OCxN) can be forced to active or inactive level directly by software,
independently of any comparison between the output compare register and the counter.
```
```
To force an output compare signal (OCXREF/OCx) to its active level, one just needs to write
101 in the OCxM bits in the corresponding TIMx_CCMRx register. Thus OCXREF is forced
high (OCxREF is always active high) and OCx get opposite value to CCxP polarity bit.
```
For example: CCxP=0 (OCx active high) => OCx is forced to high level.

```
The OCxREF signal can be forced low by writing the OCxM bits to 100 in the TIMx_CCMRx
register.
```

RM0433 Rev 8 1779/3353

**RM0433 General-purpose timers (TIM15/TIM16/TIM17)**

###### 1846

```
Anyway, the comparison between the TIMx_CCRx shadow register and the counter is still
performed and allows the flag to be set. Interrupt and DMA requests can be sent
accordingly. This is described in the output compare mode section below.
```
##### 41.4.9 Output compare mode

```
This function is used to control an output waveform or indicating when a period of time has
elapsed.
```
```
When a match is found between the capture/compare register and the counter, the output
compare function:
```
- Assigns the corresponding output pin to a programmable value defined by the output
    compare mode (OCxM bits in the TIMx_CCMRx register) and the output polarity (CCxP
    bit in the TIMx_CCER register). The output pin can keep its level (OCXM=000), be set
    active (OCxM=001), be set inactive (OCxM=010) or can toggle (OCxM=011) on match.
- Sets a flag in the interrupt status register (CCxIF bit in the TIMx_SR register).
- Generates an interrupt if the corresponding interrupt mask is set (CCXIE bit in the
    TIMx_DIER register).
- Sends a DMA request if the corresponding enable bit is set (CCxDE bit in the
    TIMx_DIER register, CCDS bit in the TIMx_CR2 register for the DMA request
    selection).

```
The TIMx_CCRx registers can be programmed with or without preload registers using the
OCxPE bit in the TIMx_CCMRx register.
```
```
In output compare mode, the update event UEV has no effect on OCxREF and OCx output.
The timing resolution is one count of the counter. Output compare mode can also be used to
output a single pulse (in One-pulse mode).
```
**Procedure**

1. Select the counter clock (internal, external, prescaler).
2. Write the desired data in the TIMx_ARR and TIMx_CCRx registers.
3. Set the CCxIE bit if an interrupt request is to be generated.
4. Select the output mode. For example:
    - Write OCxM = 011 to toggle OCx output pin when CNT matches CCRx
    - Write OCxPE = 0 to disable preload register
    - Write CCxP = 0 to select active high polarity
    - Write CCxE = 1 to enable the output
5. Enable the counter by setting the CEN bit in the TIMx_CR1 register.

```
The TIMx_CCRx register can be updated at any time by software to control the output
waveform, provided that the preload register is not enabled (OCxPE=’0’, else TIMx_CCRx
shadow register is updated only at the next update event UEV). An example is given in
Figure 499.
```

**Figure 499. Output compare mode, toggle on OC1**

##### 41.4.10 PWM mode

```
Pulse Width Modulation mode allows a signal to be generated with a frequency determined
by the value of the TIMx_ARR register and a duty cycle determined by the value of the
TIMx_CCRx register.
```
```
The PWM mode can be selected independently on each channel (one PWM per OCx
output) by writing ‘110’ (PWM mode 1) or ‘111’ (PWM mode 2) in the OCxM bits in the
TIMx_CCMRx register. The corresponding preload register must be enabled by setting the
OCxPE bit in the TIMx_CCMRx register, and eventually the auto-reload preload register (in
upcounting or center-aligned modes) by setting the ARPE bit in the TIMx_CR1 register.
```
```
As the preload registers are transferred to the shadow registers only when an update event
occurs, before starting the counter, all registers must be initialized by setting the UG bit in
the TIMx_EGR register.
```
```
OCx polarity is software programmable using the CCxP bit in the TIMx_CCER register. It
can be programmed as active high or active low. OCx output is enabled by a combination of
the CCxE, CCxNE, MOE, OSSI and OSSR bits (TIMx_CCER and TIMx_BDTR registers).
Refer to the TIMx_CCER register description for more details.
```
```
In PWM mode (1 or 2), TIMx_CNT and TIMx_CCRx are always compared to determine
whether TIMx_CCRx ≤ TIMx_CNT or TIMx_CNT ≤ TIMx_CCRx (depending on the direction
of the counter).
```
```
The TIM15/TIM16/TIM17 are capable of upcounting only. Refer to Upcounting mode on
page 1767.
```
```
In the following example, we consider PWM mode 1. The reference PWM signal OCxREF is
high as long as TIMx_CNT < TIMx_CCRx else it becomes low. If the compare value in
TIMx_CCRx is greater than the auto-reload value (in TIMx_ARR) then OCxREF is held at

‘1’. If the compare value is 0 then OCxRef is held at ‘0’. Figure 500 shows some edge-
aligned PWM waveforms in an example where TIMx_ARR=8.
```
**Figure 500. Edge-aligned PWM waveforms (ARR=8)**

##### 41.4.11 Combined PWM mode (TIM15 only)

```
Combined PWM mode allows two edge or center-aligned PWM signals to be generated with
programmable delay and phase shift between respective pulses. While the frequency is
determined by the value of the TIMx_ARR register, the duty cycle and delay are determined
by the two TIMx_CCRx registers. The resulting signals, OCxREFC, are made of an OR or
AND logical combination of two reference PWMs:
```
- OC1REFC (or OC2REFC) is controlled by the TIMx_CCR1 and TIMx_CCR2 registers

```
Combined PWM mode can be selected independently on two channels (one OCx output per
pair of CCR registers) by writing ‘1100’ (Combined PWM mode 1) or ‘1101’ (Combined PWM
mode 2) in the OCxM bits in the TIMx_CCMRx register.
```
```
When a given channel is used as a combined PWM channel, its complementary channel
must be configured in the opposite PWM mode (for instance, one in Combined PWM mode
1 and the other in Combined PWM mode 2).
```
_Note: The OCxM[3:0] bit field is split into two parts for compatibility reasons, the most significant_

_bit is not contiguous with the 3 least significant ones._

```
Figure 501 represents an example of signals that can be generated using Asymmetric PWM
mode, obtained with the following configuration:

- Channel 1 is configured in Combined PWM mode 2,
- Channel 2 is configured in PWM mode 1,

##### 41.4.12 Complementary outputs and dead-time insertion

```
The TIM15/TIM16/TIM17 general-purpose timers can output one complementary signal and
manage the switching-off and switching-on of the outputs.
```
```
This time is generally known as dead-time and it has to be adjusted depending on the
devices that are connected to the outputs and their characteristics (intrinsic delays of level-
shifters, delays due to power switches...)
```
```
The polarity of the outputs (main output OCx or complementary OCxN) can be selected
independently for each output. This is done by writing to the CCxP and CCxNP bits in the
TIMx_CCER register.
```
```
The complementary signals OCx and OCxN are activated by a combination of several
control bits: the CCxE and CCxNE bits in the TIMx_CCER register and the MOE, OISx,
OISxN, OSSI and OSSR bits in the TIMx_BDTR and TIMx_CR2 registers. Refer to
Table 349: Output control bits for complementary OCx and OCxN channels with break
feature (TIM16/17) on page 1834 for more details. In particular, the dead-time is activated
when switching to the idle state (MOE falling down to 0).
```
```
Dead-time insertion is enabled by setting both CCxE and CCxNE bits, and the MOE bit if the
break circuit is present. There is one 10-bit dead-time generator for each channel. From a

reference waveform OCxREF, it generates 2 outputs OCx and OCxN. If OCx and OCxN are
active high:
```
- The OCx output signal is the same as the reference signal except for the rising edge,
    which is delayed relative to the reference rising edge.
- The OCxN output signal is the opposite of the reference signal except for the rising
    edge, which is delayed relative to the reference falling edge.

```
If the delay is greater than the width of the active output (OCx or OCxN) then the
corresponding pulse is not generated.
```
```
The following figures show the relationships between the output signals of the dead-time
generator and the reference signal OCxREF. (we suppose CCxP=0, CCxNP=0, MOE=1,
CCxE=1 and CCxNE=1 in these examples)

1784/3353 RM0433 Rev 8

**Figure 504. Dead-time waveforms with delay greater than the positive pulse.**

```
The dead-time delay is the same for each of the channels and is programmable with the
DTG bits in the TIMx_BDTR register. Refer to Section 41.6.14: TIMx break and dead-time
register (TIMx_BDTR)(x = 16 to 17) on page 1837 for delay calculation.
```
**Re-directing OCxREF to OCx or OCxN**

```
In output mode (forced, output compare or PWM), OCxREF can be re-directed to the OCx
output or to OCxN output by configuring the CCxE and CCxNE bits in the TIMx_CCER
register.
```
```
This allows a specific waveform to be sent (such as PWM or static active level) on one
output while the complementary remains at its inactive level. Other alternative possibilities
are to have both outputs at inactive level or both outputs active and complementary with
dead-time.
```
_Note: When only OCxN is enabled (CCxE=0, CCxNE=1), it is not complemented and becomes_

```
active as soon as OCxREF is high. For example, if CCxNP=0 then OCxN=OCxRef. On the
other hand, when both OCx and OCxN are enabled (CCxE=CCxNE=1) OCx becomes
active when OCxREF is high whereas OCxN is complemented and becomes active when
OCxREF is low.
```
##### 41.4.13 Using the break function

```
The purpose of the break function is to protect power switches driven by PWM signals
generated with the TIM15/TIM16/TIM17 timers. The break input is usually connected to fault
outputs of power stages and 3-phase inverters. When activated, the break circuitry shuts
down the PWM outputs and forces them to a predefined safe state.
```
```
The break channel gathers both system-level fault (clock failure, parity error,...) and
application fault (from input pins and built-in comparator), and can force the outputs to a
predefined level (either active or inactive) after a deadtime duration.

**RM0433 General-purpose timers (TIM15/TIM16/TIM17)**

###### 1846

```
The output enable signal and output levels during break are depending on several control
bits:
```
- the MOE bit in TIMx_BDTR register allows to enable /disable the outputs by software
    and is reset in case of break or break2 event.
- the OSSI bit in the TIMx_BDTR register defines whether the timer controls the output in
    inactive state or releases the control to the GPIO controller (typically to have it in Hi-Z
    mode)
- the OISx and OISxN bits in the TIMx_CR2 register which are setting the output shut-
    down level, either active or inactive. The OCx and OCxN outputs cannot be set both to
    active level at a given time, whatever the OISx and OISxN values. Refer to _Table 347:_
    _Output control bits for complementary OCx and OCxN channels with break feature_
    _(TIM15) on page 1813_ for more details.

```
When exiting from reset, the break circuit is disabled and the MOE bit is low. The break
function is enabled by setting the BKE bit in the TIMx_BDTR register. The break input
polarity can be selected by configuring the BKP bit in the same register. BKE and BKP can
be modified at the same time. When the BKE and BKP bits are written, a delay of 1 APB
clock cycle is applied before the writing is effective. Consequently, it is necessary to wait 1
APB clock period to correctly read back the bit after the write operation.
```
```
Because MOE falling edge can be asynchronous, a resynchronization circuit has been
inserted between the actual signal (acting on the outputs) and the synchronous control bit
(accessed in the TIMx_BDTR register). It results in some delays between the asynchronous
and the synchronous signals. In particular, if MOE is set to 1 whereas it was low, a delay
must be inserted (dummy instruction) before reading it correctly. This is because the write
acts on the asynchronous signal whereas the read reflects the synchronous signal.
```
```
A programmable filter (BKF[3:0] bits in the TIMx_BDTR register allows to filter out spurious
events.
```
```
The break can be generated from multiple sources which can be individually enabled and
with programmable edge sensitivity, using the TIMx_OR2 register.
```
The sources for break (BRK) channel are:

- An external source connected to one of the BKIN pin (as per selection done in the
    GPIO alternate function registers), with polarity selection and optional digital filtering
- An internal source:
    - the output from a comparator, with polarity selection and optional digital filtering
    - the analog watchdog output of the DFSDM1 peripheral
    - A system break:
       - the Cortex
          ®
             -M7 with FPU LOCKUP output
- the PVD output
- all SRAM and TCM double ECC errors (AXI-SRAM, ITCM, DTCM, SRAM1,
SRAM2, SRAM3, SRAM4, BKRAM, refer to SYSCFG_CFGR register for details)
- a Flash double ECC error
- a clock failure event generated by the CSS detector


**General-purpose timers (TIM15/TIM16/TIM17) RM0433**

1786/3353 RM0433 Rev 8

**Figure 505. Break circuitry overview**

**Caution:** An asynchronous (clockless) operation is only guaranteed when the programmable filter is

```
disabled. If it is enabled, a fail safe clock mode (example, using the internal PLL and/or the
CSS) must be used to guarantee that break events are handled.
```
When a break occurs (selected level on the break input):

- The MOE bit is cleared asynchronously, putting the outputs in inactive state, idle state
    or even releasing the control to the GPIO (selected by the OSSI bit). This feature
    functions even if the MCU oscillator is off.
- Each output channel is driven with the level programmed in the OISx bit in the
    TIMx_CR2 register as soon as MOE=0. If OSSI=0, the timer releases the output control
    (taken over by the GPIO) else the enable output remains high.
- When complementary outputs are used:
    - The outputs are first put in reset state inactive state (depending on the polarity).
       This is done asynchronously so that it works even if no clock is provided to the
       timer.
    - If the timer clock is still present, then the dead-time generator is reactivated in
       order to drive the outputs with the level programmed in the OISx and OISxN bits
       after a dead-time. Even in this case, OCx and OCxN cannot be driven to their

active level together. Note that because of the resynchronization on MOE, the
dead-time duration is a bit longer than usual (around 2 ck_tim clock cycles).
```
- If OSSI=0 then the timer releases the enable outputs (taken over by the GPIO
    which forces a Hi-Z state) else the enable outputs remain or become high as soon
    as one of the CCxE or CCxNE bits is high.
- The break status flag (BIF bit in the TIMx_SR register) is set. An interrupt can be
generated if the BIE bit in the TIMx_DIER register is set.
- If the AOE bit in the TIMx_BDTR register is set, the MOE bit is automatically set again
at the next update event UEV. This can be used to perform a regulation, for instance.
Else, MOE remains low until it is written with 1 again. In this case, it can be used for
security and the break input can be connected to an alarm from power drivers, thermal
sensors or any security components.

_Note: If the MOE is reset by the CPU while the AOE bit is set, the outputs are in idle state and_

```
forced to inactive level or Hi-Z depending on OSSI value.
If both the MOE and AOE bits are reset by the CPU, the outputs are in disabled state and
driven with the level programmed in the OISx bit in the TIMx_CR2 register.
```
_Note: The break inputs is acting on level. Thus, the MOE cannot be set while the break input is_

```
active (neither automatically nor by software). In the meantime, the status flag BIF cannot
be cleared.
```
```
The break can be generated by the BRK input which has a programmable polarity and an
enable bit BKE in the TIMx_BDTR register.
```
```
In addition to the break input and the output management, a write protection has been
implemented inside the break circuit to safeguard the application. It allows the configuration
of several parameters to be freezed (dead-time duration, OCx/OCxN polarities and state
when disabled, OCxM configurations, break enable and polarity). The protection can be
selected among 3 levels with the LOCK bits in the TIMx_BDTR register. Refer to
Section 41.6.14: TIMx break and dead-time register (TIMx_BDTR)(x = 16 to 17) on
page 1837. The LOCK bits can be written only once after an MCU reset.
```
The _Figure 506_ shows an example of behavior of the outputs in response to a break.

##### 41.4.14 6-step PWM generation

```
When complementary outputs are used on a channel, preload bits are available on the
OCxM, CCxE and CCxNE bits. The preload bits are transferred to the shadow bits at the
COM commutation event. Thus one can program in advance the configuration for the next
step and change the configuration of all the channels at the same time. COM can be
generated by software by setting the COM bit in the TIMx_EGR register or by hardware (on
tim_trgi rising edge).
```
```
A flag is set when the COM event occurs (COMIF bit in the TIMx_SR register), which can
generate an interrupt (if the COMIE bit is set in the TIMx_DIER register) or a DMA request
(if the COMDE bit is set in the TIMx_DIER register).
```
```
The Figure 507 describes the behavior of the tim_ocx and tim_ocxn outputs when a COM
event occurs, in 3 different examples of programmed configurations.

##### 41.4.15 One-pulse mode

```
One-pulse mode (OPM) is a particular case of the previous modes. It allows the counter to
be started in response to a stimulus and to generate a pulse with a programmable length
after a programmable delay.
```
```
Starting the counter can be controlled through the slave mode controller. Generating the
waveform can be done in output compare mode or PWM mode. One-pulse mode is selected
by setting the OPM bit in the TIMx_CR1 register. This makes the counter stop automatically
at the next update event UEV.
```
```
A pulse can be correctly generated only if the compare value is different from the counter
initial value. Before starting (when the timer is waiting for the trigger), the configuration must
be:
```
- CNT < CCRx ≤ ARR (in particular, 0 < CCRx)

**Figure 508. Example of one pulse mode**

```
For example one may want to generate a positive pulse on OC1 with a length of tPULSE and
after a delay of tDELAY as soon as a positive edge is detected on the TI2 input pin.
```
Let’s use TI2FP2 as trigger 1:

1. Select the proper TI2[x] source (internal or external) with the TI2SEL[3:0] bits in the
    TIMx_TISEL register.
2. Map TI2FP2 to TI2 by writing CC2S=’01’ in the TIMx_CCMR1 register.
3. TI2FP2 must detect a rising edge, write CC2P=’0’ and CC2NP=’0’ in the TIMx_CCER
    register.
4. Configure TI2FP2 as trigger for the slave mode controller (TRGI) by writing TS=’00110’
    in the TIMx_SMCR register.
5. TI2FP2 is used to start the counter by writing SMS to ‘110’ in the TIMx_SMCR register
    (trigger mode).

###### 1846

```
The OPM waveform is defined by writing the compare registers (taking into account the
clock frequency and the counter prescaler).
```
- The tDELAY is defined by the value written in the TIMx_CCR1 register.
- The tPULSE is defined by the difference between the auto-reload value and the compare
    value (TIMx_ARR - TIMx_CCR1).
- Let’s say one want to build a waveform with a transition from ‘0’ to ‘1’ when a compare
    match occurs and a transition from ‘1’ to ‘0’ when the counter reaches the auto-reload
    value. To do this PWM mode 2 must be enabled by writing OC1M=111 in the
    TIMx_CCMR1 register. Optionally the preload registers can be enabled by writing
    OC1PE=’1’ in the TIMx_CCMR1 register and ARPE in the TIMx_CR1 register. In this
    case one has to write the compare value in the TIMx_CCR1 register, the auto-reload
    value in the TIMx_ARR register, generate an update by setting the UG bit and wait for
    external trigger event on TI2. CC1P is written to ‘0’ in this example.

```
Since only 1 pulse is needed, a 1 must be written in the OPM bit in the TIMx_CR1 register to
stop the counter at the next update event (when the counter rolls over from the auto-reload
value back to 0).
```
Particular case: OCx fast enable

```
In One-pulse mode, the edge detection on TIx input set the CEN bit which enables the
counter. Then the comparison between the counter and the compare value makes the
output toggle. But several clock cycles are needed for these operations and it limits the
minimum delay tDELAY min we can get.
```
```
If one wants to output a waveform with the minimum delay, the OCxFE bit can be set in the
TIMx_CCMRx register. Then OCxRef (and OCx) are forced in response to the stimulus,
without taking in account the comparison. Its new level is the same as if a compare match
had occurred. OCxFE acts only if the channel is configured in PWM1 or PWM2 mode.
```
##### 41.4.16 Retriggerable one pulse mode (TIM15 only)

```
This mode allows the counter to be started in response to a stimulus and to generate a
pulse with a programmable length, but with the following differences with Non-retriggerable
one pulse mode described in Section 41.4.15 :
```
- The pulse starts as soon as the trigger occurs (no programmable delay)
- The pulse is extended if a new trigger occurs before the previous one is completed

```
The timer must be in Slave mode, with the bits SMS[3:0] = ‘1000’ (Combined Reset + trigger
mode) in the TIMx_SMCR register, and the OCxM[3:0] bits set to ‘1000’ or ‘1001’ for
Retrigerrable OPM mode 1 or 2.
```
```
If the timer is configured in Up-counting mode, the corresponding CCRx must be set to 0
(the ARR register sets the pulse length). If the timer is configured in Down-counting mode,
CCRx must be above or equal to ARR.
```
_Note: The OCxM[3:0] and SMS[3:0] bit fields are split into two parts for compatibility reasons, the_

_most significant bit are not contiguous with the 3 least significant ones._

```
This mode must not be used with center-aligned PWM modes. It is mandatory to have
CMS[1:0] = 00 in TIMx_CR1.

##### 41.4.17 UIF bit remapping

```
The IUFREMAP bit in the TIMx_CR1 register forces a continuous copy of the Update
Interrupt Flag UIF into bit 31 of the timer counter register (TIMxCNT[31]). This allows both
the counter value and a potential roll-over condition signaled by the UIFCPY flag, to be
atomically read. In particular cases, it can ease the calculations by avoiding race conditions
caused for instance by a processing shared between a background task (counter reading)
and an interrupt (Update Interrupt).
```
There is no latency between the assertions of the UIF and UIFCPY flags.

##### 41.4.18 Timer input XOR function (TIM15 only)

```
The TI1S bit in the TIMx_CR2 register, allows the input filter of channel 1 to be connected to
the output of a XOR gate, combining the two input pins TIMx_CH1 and TIMx_CH2.
```
```
The XOR output can be used with all the timer input functions such as trigger or input
capture. It is useful for measuring the interval between the edges on two input signals, as
shown in Figure 510.

##### 41.4.19 External trigger synchronization (TIM15 only)

The TIM timers are linked together internally for timer synchronization or chaining.

```
The TIM15 timer can be synchronized with an external trigger in several modes: Reset
mode, Gated mode and Trigger mode.
```
**Slave mode: Reset mode**

```
The counter and its prescaler can be reinitialized in response to an event on a trigger input.
Moreover, if the URS bit from the TIMx_CR1 register is low, an update event UEV is
generated. Then all the preloaded registers (TIMx_ARR, TIMx_CCRx) are updated.
```
In the following example, the upcounter is cleared in response to a rising edge on TI1 input:

1. Configure the channel 1 to detect rising edges on TI1. Configure the input filter duration
    (in this example, we do not need any filter, so we keep IC1F=0000). The capture
    prescaler is not used for triggering, so it does not need to be configured. The CC1S bits
    select the input capture source only, CC1S = 01 in the TIMx_CCMR1 register. Write
    CC1P=’0’ and CC1NP=’0’ in the TIMx_CCER register to validate the polarity (and
    detect rising edges only).
2. Configure the timer in reset mode by writing SMS=100 in TIMx_SMCR register. Select
    TI1 as the input source by writing TS=00101 in TIMx_SMCR register.
3. Start the counter by writing CEN=1 in the TIMx_CR1 register.

```
The counter starts counting on the internal clock, then behaves normally until TI1 rising
edge. When TI1 rises, the counter is cleared and restarts from 0. In the meantime, the
trigger flag is set (TIF bit in the TIMx_SR register) and an interrupt request, or a DMA
request can be sent if enabled (depending on the TIE and TDE bits in TIMx_DIER register).
```
```
The following figure shows this behavior when the auto-reload register TIMx_ARR=0x36.
The delay between the rising edge on TI1 and the actual reset of the counter is due to the
resynchronization circuit on TI1 input.

**Slave mode: Gated mode**

The counter can be enabled depending on the level of a selected input.

In the following example, the upcounter counts only when TI1 input is low:

1. Configure the channel 1 to detect low levels on TI1. Configure the input filter duration
    (in this example, we do not need any filter, so we keep IC1F=0000). The capture
    prescaler is not used for triggering, so it does not need to be configured. The CC1S bits
    select the input capture source only, CC1S=01 in TIMx_CCMR1 register. Write
    CC1P=1 and CC1NP = ‘0’ in the TIMx_CCER register to validate the polarity (and
    detect low level only).
2. Configure the timer in gated mode by writing SMS=101 in TIMx_SMCR register. Select
    TI1 as the input source by writing TS=00101 in TIMx_SMCR register.
3. Enable the counter by writing CEN=1 in the TIMx_CR1 register (in gated mode, the
    counter doesn’t start if CEN=0, whatever is the trigger input level).

```
The counter starts counting on the internal clock as long as TI1 is low and stops as soon as
TI1 becomes high. The TIF flag in the TIMx_SR register is set both when the counter starts
or stops.
```
```
The delay between the rising edge on TI1 and the actual stop of the counter is due to the
resynchronization circuit on TI1 input.

**Slave mode: Trigger mode**

The counter can start in response to an event on a selected input.

In the following example, the upcounter starts in response to a rising edge on TI2 input:

1. Configure the channel 2 to detect rising edges on TI2. Configure the input filter duration
    (in this example, we do not need any filter, so we keep IC2F=0000). The capture
    prescaler is not used for triggering, so it does not need to be configured. The CC2S bits
    are configured to select the input capture source only, CC2S=01 in TIMx_CCMR1
    register. Write CC2P=’1’ and CC2NP=’0’ in the TIMx_CCER register to validate the
    polarity (and detect low level only).
2. Configure the timer in trigger mode by writing SMS=110 in the TIMx_SMCR register.
    Select TI2 as the input source by writing TS=00110 in the TIMx_SMCR register.

```
When a rising edge occurs on TI2, the counter starts counting on the internal clock and the
TIF flag is set.
```
```
The delay between the rising edge on TI2 and the actual start of the counter is due to the
resynchronization circuit on TI2 input.
```
**Figure 513. Control circuit in trigger mode**

##### 41.4.20 Slave mode – combined reset + trigger mode

```
In this case, a rising edge of the selected trigger input (TRGI) reinitializes the counter,
generates an update of the registers, and starts the counter.
```
This mode is used for one-pulse mode.

##### 41.4.21 DMA burst mode

```
The TIMx timers have the capability to generate multiple DMA requests on a single event.
The main purpose is to be able to re-program several timer registers multiple times without
software overhead, but it can also be used to read several registers in a row, at regular
intervals.
```
```
The DMA controller destination is unique and must point to the virtual register TIMx_DMAR.
On a given timer event, the timer launches a sequence of DMA requests (burst). Each write
into the TIMx_DMAR register is actually redirected to one of the timer registers.

###### 1846

```
The DBL[4:0] bits in the TIMx_DCR register set the DMA burst length. The timer recognizes
a burst transfer when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the
number of transfers (either in half-words or in bytes).
```
```
The DBA[4:0] bits in the TIMx_DCR registers define the DMA base address for DMA
transfers (when read/write access are done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is
defined as an offset starting from the address of the TIMx_CR1 register.
```
Example:

00000: TIMx_CR1,

00001: TIMx_CR2,

00010: TIMx_SMCR,

```
For example, the timer DMA burst feature could be used to update the contents of the CCRx
registers (x = 2, 3, 4) on an update event, with the DMA transferring half words into the
CCRx registers.
```
This is done in the following steps:

1. Configure the corresponding DMA channel as follows:
    - DMA channel peripheral address is the DMAR register address
    - DMA channel memory address is the address of the buffer in the RAM containing
       the data to be transferred by DMA into the CCRx registers.
    - Number of data to transfer = 3 (See note below).
    - Circular mode disabled.
2. Configure the DCR register by configuring the DBA and DBL bit fields as follows:
    DBL = 3 transfers, DBA = 0xE.
3. Enable the TIMx update DMA request (set the UDE bit in the DIER register).
4. Enable TIMx
5. Enable the DMA channel

```
This example is for the case where every CCRx register is to be updated once. If every
CCRx register is to be updated twice for example, the number of data to transfer should be
```
6. Let's take the example of a buffer in the RAM containing data1, data2, data3, data4, data5
and data6. The data is transferred to the CCRx registers as follows: on the first update DMA
request, data1 is transferred to CCR2, data2 is transferred to CCR3, data3 is transferred to
CCR4 and on the second update DMA request, data4 is transferred to CCR2, data5 is
transferred to CCR3 and data6 is transferred to CCR4.

_Note: A null value can be written to the reserved registers._

##### 41.4.22 Timer synchronization (TIM15)

```
The TIMx timers are linked together internally for timer synchronization or chaining. Refer to
Section 39.3.19: Timer synchronization for details.
```
_Note: The clock of the slave peripherals (timer, ADC, ...) receiving the TRGO or the TRGO2_

```
signals must be enabled prior to receive events from the master timer, and the clock
frequency (prescaler) must not be changed on-the-fly while triggers are received from the
master timer.
```
##### 41.4.23 Using timer output as trigger for other timers (TIM16/TIM17)

```
The timers with one channel only do not feature a master mode. However, the OC1 output
signal can be used to trigger some other timers (including timers described in other sections
of this document). Check the “TIMx internal trigger connection” table of any TIMx_SMCR
register on the device to identify which timers can be targeted as slave.
```
```
The OC1 signal pulse width must be programmed to be at least 2 clock cycles of the
destination timer, to make sure the slave timer detects the trigger.
```
```
For instance, if the destination's timer CK_INT clock is 4 times slower than the source timer,
the OC1 pulse width must be 8 clock cycles.
```
##### 41.4.24 Debug mode

```
When the microcontroller enters debug mode (Cortex
®
-M7 with FPU core halted), the TIMx
counter either continues to work normally or stops, depending on TIMx bit in DBGMCU
module. For more details, refer to Section 60.5.8: Microcontroller debug unit (DBGMCU).
```
```
For safety purposes, when the counter is stopped (TIMx = 1 in DBGMCU_APB2FZ1), the
outputs are disabled (as if the MOE bit was reset). The outputs can either be forced to an
inactive state (OSSI bit = 1), or have their control taken over by the GPIO controller (OSSI
bit = 0) to force them to Hi-Z.

1: The TIMx_CH1, CH2 pins are connected to the TI1 input (XOR combination)
```
Bits 6:4 **MMS[2:0]** : Master mode selection

```
These bits allow to select the information to be sent in master mode to slave timers for
synchronization (TRGO). The combination is as follows:
000: Reset - the UG bit from the TIMx_EGR register is used as trigger output (TRGO). If the
reset is generated by the trigger input (slave mode controller configured in reset mode)
then the signal on TRGO is delayed compared to the actual reset.
001: Enable - the Counter Enable signal CNT_EN is used as trigger output (TRGO). It is
useful to start several timers at the same time or to control a window in which a slave
timer is enable. The Counter Enable signal is generated by a logic AND between CEN
control bit and the trigger input when configured in gated mode. When the Counter
Enable signal is controlled by the trigger input, there is a delay on TRGO, except if the
master/slave mode is selected (see the MSM bit description in TIMx_SMCR register).
010: Update - The update event is selected as trigger output (TRGO). For instance a master
timer can then be used as a prescaler for a slave timer.
011: Compare Pulse - The trigger output send a positive pulse when the CC1IF flag is to be
set (even if it was already high), as soon as a capture or a compare match occurred.

100: Compare - OC1REFC signal is used as trigger output (TRGO).
101: Compare - OC2REFC signal is used as trigger output (TRGO).

```
0: CCx DMA request sent when CCx event occurs

```
0: When capture/compare control bits are preloaded (CCPC=1), they are updated by setting
the COMG bit only.
1: When capture/compare control bits are preloaded (CCPC=1), they are updated by setting
the COMG bit or when an rising edge occurs on TRGI.

Bits 16, 2, 1, 0 **SMS[3:0]:** Slave mode selection

```
When external signals are selected the active edge of the trigger signal (TRGI) is linked to
the polarity selected on the external input (see Input Control register and Control register
description.
0000: Slave mode disabled - if CEN = ‘1’ then the prescaler is clocked directly by the
internal clock.
0001: Reserved
0010: Reserved
0011: Reserved
0100: Reset Mode - Rising edge of the selected trigger input (TRGI) reinitializes the counter
and generates an update of the registers.
0101: Gated Mode - The counter clock is enabled when the trigger input (TRGI) is high. The
counter stops (but is not reset) as soon as the trigger becomes low. Both start and
stop of the counter are controlled.
0110: Trigger Mode - The counter starts at a rising edge of the trigger TRGI (but it is not
reset). Only the start of the counter is controlled.
0111: External Clock Mode 1 - Rising edges of the selected trigger (TRGI) clock the counter.
1000: Combined reset + trigger mode - Rising edge of the selected trigger input (TRGI)
reinitializes the counter, generates an update of the registers and starts the counter.
Other codes: reserved.
```
```
Note: The gated mode must not be used if TI1F_ED is selected as the trigger input
(TS=’00100’). Indeed, TI1F_ED outputs 1 pulse for each transition on TI1F, whereas
the gated mode checks the level of the trigger signal.
```
```
Note: The clock of the slave peripherals (timer, ADC, ...) receiving the TRGO or the TRGO2
signals must be enabled prior to receive events from the master timer, and the clock
frequency (prescaler) must not be changed on-the-fly while triggers are received from
the master timer.

Bits 16, 6:4 **OC1M[3:0]** : Output Compare 1 mode

```
These bits define the behavior of the output reference signal OC1REF from which OC1 and
OC1N are derived. OC1REF is active high whereas OC1 and OC1N active level depends
on CC1P and CC1NP bits.
0000: Frozen - The comparison between the output compare register TIMx_CCR1 and the
counter TIMx_CNT has no effect on the outputs.
0001: Set channel 1 to active level on match. OC1REF signal is forced high when the
counter TIMx_CNT matches the capture/compare register 1 (TIMx_CCR1).
0010: Set channel 1 to inactive level on match. OC1REF signal is forced low when the
counter TIMx_CNT matches the capture/compare register 1 (TIMx_CCR1).
0011: Toggle - OC1REF toggles when TIMx_CNT=TIMx_CCR1.
0100: Force inactive level - OC1REF is forced low.
0101: Force active level - OC1REF is forced high.
0110: PWM mode 1 - Channel 1 is active as long as TIMx_CNT<TIMx_CCR1 else inactive.
0111: PWM mode 2 - Channel 1 is inactive as long as TIMx_CNT<TIMx_CCR1 else active.
1000: Retrigerrable OPM mode 1 - In up-counting mode, the channel is active until a trigger
event is detected (on TRGI signal). Then, a comparison is performed as in PWM
mode 1 and the channels becomes active again at the next update. In down-counting
mode, the channel is inactive until a trigger event is detected (on TRGI signal). Then,
a comparison is performed as in PWM mode 1 and the channels becomes inactive
again at the next update.
1001: Retrigerrable OPM mode 2 - In up-counting mode, the channel is inactive until a
trigger event is detected (on TRGI signal). Then, a comparison is performed as in
PWM mode 2 and the channels becomes inactive again at the next update. In down-
counting mode, the channel is active until a trigger event is detected (on TRGI
signal). Then, a comparison is performed as in PWM mode 1 and the channels
becomes active again at the next update.
1010: Reserved
1011: Reserved
1100: Combined PWM mode 1 - OC1REF has the same behavior as in PWM mode 1.
OC1REFC is the logical OR between OC1REF and OC2REF.

In PWM mode, the OCREF level changes only when the result of the comparison
changes or when the output compare mode switches from “frozen” mode to “PWM”
mode.
```
```
On channels that have a complementary output, this bit field is preloaded. If the CCPC
bit is set in the TIMx_CR2 register then the OC1M active bits take the new value from
the preloaded bits only when a COM event is generated.

```
0: Preload register on TIMx_CCR1 disabled. TIMx_CCR1 can be written at anytime, the
new value is taken in account immediately.
1: Preload register on TIMx_CCR1 enabled. Read/Write operations access the preload
register. TIMx_CCR1 preload value is loaded in the active register at each update event.

```
Bit 2 **OC1FE** : Output Compare 1 fast enable

```
This bit decreases the latency between a trigger event and a transition on the timer output.
It must be used in one-pulse mode (OPM bit set in TIMx_CR1 register), to have the output
pulse starting as soon as possible after the starting trigger.
0: CC1 behaves normally depending on counter and CCR1 values even when the trigger is
ON. The minimum delay to activate CC1 output when an edge occurs on the trigger input
is 5 clock cycles.
1: An active edge on the trigger input acts like a compare match on CC1 output. Then, OC is
set to the compare level independently of the result of the comparison. Delay to sample
the trigger input and to activate CC1 output is reduced to 3 clock cycles. OCFE acts only
if the channel is configured in PWM1 or PWM2 mode.

On channels that have a complementary output, this bit is preloaded. If the CCPC bit is
set in the TIMx_CR2 register then the CC1NP active bit takes the new value from the
preloaded bit only when a Commutation event is generated.
```
Bit 2 **CC1NE** : Capture/Compare 1 complementary output enable

```
0: Off - OC1N is not active. OC1N level is then function of MOE, OSSI, OSSR, OIS1, OIS1N
and CC1E bits.
1: On - OC1N signal is output on the corresponding output pin depending on MOE, OSSI,
OSSR, OIS1, OIS1N and CC1E bits.

```
0: OC1 active high (output mode) / Edge sensitivity selection (input mode, see below)
1: OC1 active low (output mode) / Edge sensitivity selection (input mode, see below)
When CC1 channel is configured as input , both CC1NP/CC1P bits select the active
polarity of TI1FP1 and TI2FP1 for trigger or capture operations.
CC1NP=0, CC1P=0: non-inverted/rising edge. The circuit is sensitive to TIxFP1 rising edge
(capture or trigger operations in reset, external clock or trigger mode),
TIxFP1 is not inverted (trigger operation in gated mode or encoder
mode).
CC1NP=0, CC1P=1: inverted/falling edge. The circuit is sensitive to TIxFP1 falling edge
(capture or trigger operations in reset, external clock or trigger mode),
TIxFP1 is inverted (trigger operation in gated mode or encoder mode).
CC1NP=1, CC1P=1: non-inverted/both edges/ The circuit is sensitive to both TIxFP1 rising
and falling edges (capture or trigger operations in reset, external clock
or trigger mode), TIxFP1is not inverted (trigger operation in gated
mode). This configuration must not be used in encoder mode.
CC1NP=1, CC1P=0: this configuration is reserved, it must not be used.
```
```
Note: This bit is not writable as soon as LOCK level 2 or 3 has been programmed (LOCK bits

```
Bit 0 **CC1E** : Capture/Compare 1 output enable

```
0: Capture mode disabled / OC1 is not active (see below)
1: Capture mode enabled / OC1 signal is output on the corresponding output pin
When CC1 channel is configured as output, the OC1 level depends on MOE, OSSI,

This 5-bit field defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer
when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address).
00000: 1 transfer,
00001: 2 transfers,
00010: 3 transfers,
...
10001: 18 transfers.
```
Bits 7:5 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

Bits 4:0 **DBA[4:0]** : DMA base address

```
This 5-bit field defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are
done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the
address of the TIMx_CR1 register.
Example:
00000: TIMx_CR1,
00001: TIMx_CR2,
00010: TIMx_SMCR,
...

Bits 15:0 **DMAB[15:0]** : DMA register for burst accesses

A read or write operation to the DMAR register accesses the register located at the address

(TIMx_CR1 address) + (DBA + DMA index) x 4

```
where TIMx_CR1 address is the address of the control register 1, DBA is the DMA base
address configured in TIMx_DCR register, DMA index is automatically controlled by the
DMA transfer, and ranges from 0 to DBL (DBL configured in TIMx_DCR).

**RM0433 General-purpose timers (TIM15/TIM16/TIM17)**

###### 1846

Bits 16, 6:4 **OC1M[3:0]** : Output Compare 1 mode

```
These bits define the behavior of the output reference signal OC1REF from which OC1 and
OC1N are derived. OC1REF is active high whereas OC1 and OC1N active level depends
on CC1P and CC1NP bits.
0000: Frozen - The comparison between the output compare register TIMx_CCR1 and the
counter TIMx_CNT has no effect on the outputs. This mode can be used when the
timer serves as a software timebase. When the frozen mode is enabled during timer
operation, the output keeps the state (active or inactive) it had before entering the
frozen state.
0001: Set channel 1 to active level on match. OC1REF signal is forced high when the
counter TIMx_CNT matches the capture/compare register 1 (TIMx_CCR1).
0010: Set channel 1 to inactive level on match. OC1REF signal is forced low when the
counter TIMx_CNT matches the capture/compare register 1 (TIMx_CCR1).
0011: Toggle - OC1REF toggles when TIMx_CNT=TIMx_CCR1.
0100: Force inactive level - OC1REF is forced low.
0101: Force active level - OC1REF is forced high.
0110: PWM mode 1 - Channel 1 is active as long as TIMx_CNT<TIMx_CCR1 else inactive.
0111: PWM mode 2 - Channel 1 is inactive as long as TIMx_CNT<TIMx_CCR1 else active.
All other values: Reserved
```
```
Note: These bits can not be modified as long as LOCK level 3 has been programmed (LOCK
bits in TIMx_BDTR register) and CC1S=’00’ (the channel is configured in output).
```
```
In PWM mode 1 or 2, the OCREF level changes only when the result of the
comparison changes or when the output compare mode switches from “frozen” mode
to “PWM” mode.
```
_The OC1M[3] bit is not contiguous, located in bit 16._

Bit 3 **OC1PE** : Output Compare 1 preload enable

```
0: Preload register on TIMx_CCR1 disabled. TIMx_CCR1 can be written at anytime, the
new value is taken in account immediately.
1: Preload register on TIMx_CCR1 enabled. Read/Write operations access the preload
register. TIMx_CCR1 preload value is loaded in the active register at each update event.
```
```
Note: These bits can not be modified as long as LOCK level 3 has been programmed (LOCK
bits in TIMx_BDTR register) and CC1S=’00’ (the channel is configured in output).
```
Bit 2 **OC1FE** : Output Compare 1 fast enable

```
This bit decreases the latency between a trigger event and a transition on the timer output.
It must be used in one-pulse mode (OPM bit set in TIMx_CR1 register), to have the output
pulse starting as soon as possible after the starting trigger.
0: CC1 behaves normally depending on counter and CCR1 values even when the trigger is
ON. The minimum delay to activate CC1 output when an edge occurs on the trigger input
is 5 clock cycles.
1: An active edge on the trigger input acts like a compare match on CC1 output. Then, OC
is set to the compare level independently of the result of the comparison. Delay to
sample the trigger input and to activate CC1 output is reduced to 3 clock cycles. OC1FE
acts only if the channel is configured in PWM1 or PWM2 mode.

0: Break inputs (BRK and CCS clock failure event) disabled
1; Break inputs (BRK and CCS clock failure event) enabled
```
```
Note: This bit cannot be modified when LOCK level 1 has been programmed (LOCK bits in
TIMx_BDTR register).
```
_Any write operation to this bit takes a delay of 1 APB clock cycle to become effective._

Bit 11 **OSSR** : Off-state selection for Run mode

```
This bit is used when MOE=1 on channels that have a complementary output which are
configured as outputs. OSSR is not implemented if no complementary output is implemented
in the timer.
See OC/OCN enable description for more details ( Section 41.6.8: TIMx capture/compare
enable register (TIMx_CCER)(x = 16 to 17) on page 1832 ).
0: When inactive, OC/OCN outputs are disabled (the timer releases the output control which
is taken over by the GPIO, which forces a Hi-Z state)
1: When inactive, OC/OCN outputs are enabled with their inactive level as soon as CCxE=1
or CCxNE=1 (the output is still controlled by the timer).
```
```
Note: This bit can not be modified as soon as the LOCK level 2 has been programmed (LOCK
bits in TIMx_BDTR register).

This bit is used when MOE=0 on channels configured as outputs.
See OC/OCN enable description for more details ( Section 41.6.8: TIMx capture/compare
enable register (TIMx_CCER)(x = 16 to 17) on page 1832 ).
0: When inactive, OC/OCN outputs are disabled (OC/OCN enable output signal=0)

```
```
Note: This bit can not be modified as soon as the LOCK level 2 has been programmed (LOCK

```
Bits 9:8 **LOCK[1:0]** : Lock configuration

```
These bits offer a write protection against software errors.
00: LOCK OFF - No bit is write protected
01: LOCK Level 1 = DTG bits in TIMx_BDTR register, OISx and OISxN bits in TIMx_CR2
register and BKE/BKP/AOE bits in TIMx_BDTR register can no longer be written.
10: LOCK Level 2 = LOCK Level 1 + CC Polarity bits (CCxP/CCxNP bits in TIMx_CCER
register, as long as the related channel is configured in output through the CCxS bits) as well
as OSSR and OSSI bits can no longer be written.
11: LOCK Level 3 = LOCK Level 2 + CC Control bits (OCxM and OCxPE bits in
TIMx_CCMRx registers, as long as the related channel is configured in output through the
CCxS bits) can no longer be written.
```
```
Note: The LOCK bits can be written only once after the reset. Once the TIMx_BDTR register
has been written, their content is frozen until the next reset.
```
Bits 7:0 **DTG[7:0]** : Dead-time generator setup

```
This bit-field defines the duration of the dead-time inserted between the complementary
outputs. DT correspond to this duration.
DTG[7:5] = 0xx => DT = DTG[7:0] x tdtg with tdtg = tDTS
DTG[7:5] = 10x => DT = (64 + DTG[5:0]) x tdtg with tdtg = 2 x tDTS
DTG[7:5] = 110 => DT = (32 + DTG[4:0]) x tdtg with tdtg = 8 x tDTS
DTG[7:5] = 111 => DT = (32 + DTG[4:0]) x tdtg with tdtg = 16 x tDTS
Example if tDTS = 125 ns (8 MHz), dead-time possible values are:
0 to 15875 ns by 125 ns steps,
16 μs to 31750 ns by 250 ns steps,
32 μs to 63 μs by 1 μs steps,
64 μs to 126 μs by 2 μs steps
```
```
Note: This bit-field can not be modified as long as LOCK level 1, 2 or 3 has been programmed
(LOCK bits in TIMx_BDTR register).

Reset value: 0x0000

Bits 15:13 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

Bits 12:8 **DBL[4:0]** : DMA burst length

```
This 5-bit field defines the length of DMA transfers (the timer recognizes a burst transfer
when a read or a write access is done to the TIMx_DMAR address), i.e. the number of
transfers. Transfers can be in half-words or in bytes (see example below).
00000: 1 transfer,
00001: 2 transfers,
00010: 3 transfers,
...
10001: 18 transfers.
```
Bits 7:5 Reserved, must be kept at reset value.

Bits 4:0 **DBA[4:0]** : DMA base address

```
This 5-bit field defines the base-address for DMA transfers (when read/write access are
done through the TIMx_DMAR address). DBA is defined as an offset starting from the
address of the TIMx_CR1 register.
Example:
00000: TIMx_CR1,
00001: TIMx_CR2,
00010: TIMx_SMCR,
...
```
```
Example: Let us consider the following transfer: DBL = 7 transfers and DBA = TIMx_CR1. In
this case the transfer is done to/from 7 registers starting from the TIMx_CR1 address.

```
where TIMx_CR1 address is the address of the control register 1, DBA is the DMA base
address configured in TIMx_DCR register, DMA index is automatically controlled by the
DMA transfer, and ranges from 0 to DBL (DBL configured in TIMx_DCR).
